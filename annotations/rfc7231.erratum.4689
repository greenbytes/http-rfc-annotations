3.1.1.2.  Charset

   HTTP uses charset names to indicate or negotiate the character
   encoding scheme of a textual representation [RFC6365].  A charset is
   identified by a case-insensitive token.

     charset = token

   Charset names ought to be registered in the IANA "Character Sets"
   registry (<&shy;http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets>) according
   to the procedures defined in [RFC2978].

<div class="note">
The definition of charset from RFC 5987 is more strict and more correct.

Mark Nottingham: This is not an errata; it is a suggestion for a
technical change in the document, and needs to be discussed by the
working group.
