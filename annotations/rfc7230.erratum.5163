<div class="original"><pre>
A field value might be preceded and/or followed by optional
whitespace (OWS); a single SP preceding the field-value is preferred
for consistent readability by humans.  The field value does not
include any leading or trailing whitespace: OWS occurring before the
first non-whitespace octet of the field value or after the last
non-whitespace octet of the field value ought to be excluded by
parsers when extracting the field value from a header field.

All optional whitespace between tokens in field-content has the same
semantics as SP. Any sequence of SP / HTAB that occurs between tokens
in field-content MAY be replaced with a single SP before interpreting

@@RFC 2616, section 2.2@@, contained the following text:
<br/><br/>
All linear white space, including folding, has the same semantics as SP.
A recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before
interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream.
<br/><br/>
Similarly, @@RFC 2616 section 4.2@@ contained the following text:
Any LWS that occurs between field-content MAY be replaced with a single
SP before interpreting the field value or forwarding the message
downstream.
<br/><br/>
In @@section A.2@@. Changes from @@RFC 2616@@, the document does not list any
intended change for how space and tab are handled, but the current text
does appear to constitute a change. I suspect the change is accidental
due to rewording the document when line folding was made deprecated.
<br/><br/>
Note that in @@RFC 2616@@, LWS is defined as follows:
<br/><br/>
LWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )
<br/><br/>
In particular, the leading CRLF was optional.
<br/><br/>
Thus, the wording in RFC 2616 covered two cases:
<br/>
<ol>
<li>LWS that includes line folding.</li>
<li>LWS that does not include line folding.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
The current text does cover how to handle case #1 - former LWS that
began with a CRLF; later in @@section 3.2.4@@ it requires rejecting or
replacing with SP. (The old "MAY" language has effectively become a
"MUST" for the leading CRLF case.)
<br/><br/>
However, the current text does not appear to address case #2 - former
LWS that does not begin with a CRLF - in other words, SP and HTAB
occurring between field-content. I suspect the intention is still that a
recipient should treat such whitespace as insignificant, and may
replace any sequence of SP and HTAB with a single SP before interpreting
the field content, but I believe the text of the current RFC no longer
provides this behavior.

(I have not read all of the specifications in full, so please accept my
apologies if I have misread or missed a relevant portion elsewhere.)
