<div class="original"><pre>
A server MUST generate a Content-Length field with a value of "0" if no
payload body is to be sent in the response.
</pre></div>

<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
If no payload body is to be sent in the response, a server MUST
generate a status code of 204 (No Content) or a Content-Length field
with a value of "0" (but not both).
</pre></div>

<div class="note">
The original text contradicts RFC 7230 §3.3.2: “A server MUST NOT send a
Content-Length header field in any response with a status code of 1xx
(Informational) or 204 (No Content)”, unless the intention was to
disallow all 204 responses to OPTIONS requests, which I assume it was
not.
