<div class="original"><pre>
   The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates that the target
   resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future
   references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
   The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates that the target
   resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future
   references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.
   <ins>The user agent MUST NOT change the request method if it performs
   an automatic redirection to that URI.</ins>

and/or add note as is present in RFC 7538, e.g.:

      <ins>Note: This status code is similar to 301 (Moved Permanently)
      (Section 15.4.2), except that it does not allow changing
      the request method from POST to GET.</ins>
</pre></div>

<div class="note">
The current text in this section for 308 Permanent Redirect does not
include any mention of the user agent not changing the request method. I
am suggesting that similar wording be used as in 15.4.8.  307 Temporary
Redirect and/or a note added similar to the one present in @@RFC 7538@@ but
excluded from this section's current text. Whichever is chosen, it
would be good to make the wording/notes consistent across both the 307
and 308 status code sections.
