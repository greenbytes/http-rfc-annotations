<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
<ins>The name part of a transfer-parameter is case insensitive and MUST not
be "q" (as this would be ambiguous when used as part of the TE header).</ins>
</pre></div>

<hr/>
<div class="note">
Nothing is said about how to handle transfer-parameters.
Notably, nothing is said about the case sensitivity of the parameter
key.
<br/><br/>
This results in a conflict with the TE header: if you see a "q" token,
you cannot know if it is a transfer-parameter vs a t-ranking.
<br/><br/>
It *is* noted that the "q" token is case insensitive in @@section 4.3@@.
<br/><br/>
&gt; When multiple transfer codings are acceptable, the client MAY rank
<br/>
&gt; the codings by preference using a case-insensitive "q" parameter
<br/><br/>
Alexey: as per Mark, this should be discussed in the HTTPBis WG.
