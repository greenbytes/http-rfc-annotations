If a DELETE method is successfully applied, the origin server SHOULD
send a 202 (Accepted) status code if the action will likely succeed
but has not yet been enacted, a 204 (No Content) status code if the
action has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied,
or a 200 (OK) status code if the action has been enacted and the
response message includes a representation describing the status.

<div class="note">
Using a semicolon creates a stronger delineation of the different
options. If you are just quickly trying to parse what status to return
if the delete hasn't happened yet and you quickly read "has not yet been
enacted, a 204 (No Content)" you could incorrectly read that as return
a 204. The semicolon makes it more obvious that "enacted" is the end of
that thought and to scan backwards where as the comma in this instance
requires knowing the structure of the rest of the paragraph.

----- Verifier Notes -----
<br/><br/>
There's no reason to use semicolons to delimit this list, because the
list items themselves don't contain commas.  Still, the reporter's
confusion is noted.  Perhaps a bullet list would be better in this case:
<br/><br/>
-------
<br/><br/>
If a DELETE method is successfully applied, the origin server SHOULD
send
<br/><br/>
- a 202 (Accepted) status code if the action will likely succeed
but has not yet been enacted,
<br/>
- a 204 (No Content) status code if the action has been enacted and
no further information is to be supplied, or
<br/>
- a 200 (OK) status code if the action has been enacted and the
response message includes a representation describing the status.
