<div class="note">
The infamous "implicit *LWS" syntax rule in @@RFC 2616@@ allowed whitespace
between
";" and chunk-ext-name in chunk-ext. Some HTTP agents generate that
whitespace.
In my experience, HTTP agents that can parse chunk extensions usually
can handle
that whitespace. Moreover, ICAP, which generally relies on HTTP/1 for
its message
syntax, uses that whitespace when defining the "ieof" chunk extension in
@@RFC 3507
Section 4.5@@:
<br/><br/>
<pre>
\r\n
0; ieof\r\n\r\n
</pre>
<br/>
IMHO, RFC 7230 should either allow BWS before chunk-ext-name or at the
very least
explicitly document the HTTP/1 syntax change and its effect on parsers
used for both
ICAP and HTTP/1 messages (a very common case for ICAP-supporting HTTP
intermediaries and ICAP services).
<br/><br/>
I also recommend adding BWS around "=", for consistency and RFC 2616
backward
compatibility reasons. HTTPbis RFCs already do that for transfer-
parameter and
auth-param that have similar syntax.
<br/><br/>
Please also consider adding BWS _before_ ";" for consistency and RFC
2616 backward
compatibility reasons. HTTPbis RFCs already do that for transfer-
extension,
accept-ext,  t-ranking, and other constructs with similar syntax.
