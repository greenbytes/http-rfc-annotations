For byte ranges, failing to overlap the current extent means that the
   first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than
   the current length of the selected representation.

<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
For byte ranges, failing to overlap the current extent means that the
   first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than
   <ins>or equal</ins> to the current length of the selected representation.

<div class="note">
If the length of the representation is 500 bytes, then the range of the
entire representation is 0-499. Then a range starting at byte position
500 fails to overlap the representation.
