<div class="note">
Basically HTTP RFCs seem to prefer "status code" over "response code".
@@RFC 7231 Section 6@@ uses status code or "Response Status Code", but
rarely uses the term "response code" (though it uses it, once). Some
technical books actually refer those codes as "response codes". I tend
to be confused with the mixture of those two terms.
