<div class="correct">It should say:<pre>
     field-name     = token
     field-value    = *( field-content / obs-fold )
     field-content  = field-vchar [ 1*( SP / HTAB <del>)</del><ins>/</ins> field-vchar <ins>)

     obs-fold       = OWS CRLF 1*( SP / HTAB )

<hr/>
<div class="note">
the field-value rule given in @@Section 3.2@@ will not recognize several
strings recognized by specific header rules.
<br/><br/>
Examples:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>", , ," recognized by legacy list rule</li>
<li>"abrowser/0.001 (C O M M E N T)" recognized by User-Agent rule</li>
<li>"gzip , chunked" recognized by Transfer-Encoding rule</li>
</ul>
<br/>
General Problem:
the specified field-value rule does not allow single field-vchar
surrounded by whitespace anywhere
<br/><br/>
Further Notes:
<br/><br/>
-what the authors propably wanted to say:
a string of octets is a field-value if, and only if:
<ul>
<li>it is *( field-vchar / SP / HTAB / obs-fold )</li>
<li>if it is not empty, it starts and ends with field-vchar</li>
</ul>
-the suggested correction was designed according to these criteria
<br/><br/>
--------------------- Notes from verifier ---------------------
<br/>
This has been edited from the original report after discussion, but even
this is not right.  There's more here than can be reasonably fixed in
an errata report, and the proper fix needs to be done in a revision of
the document -- hence, "Held for Document Update".  Note that this *is*
a valid report, and that a fix is needed.  The one above is the best
approach for now, and a better fix will be developed in 7230bis.
